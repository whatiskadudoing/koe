# Koe 声

### Speak. It types. That's it.

The open-source dictation app for macOS that actually respects you. No cloud. No subscription. No BS.

Your voice hits your Mac's neural engine and becomes text—instantly, privately, completely offline. Powered by [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit), the same tech behind the best speech recognition on the planet.
