    "response": "The tone of the message is **concerned and slightly urgent**. It's not overly emotional, but it carries a sense of worry and a need for action. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the sentiment:\n\n* **Concerned:** This is the primary sentiment. The message clearly expresses worry about the timeline.\n* **Negative (but not overtly angry):** The phrase \"stakeholders are getting frustrated\" indicates a negative consequence of the timeline issues. It's not a harsh accusation, but a statement of fact about the impact.\n* **Neutral/Objective:** The language is relatively neutral and factual. It doesn't use strong emotional words like \"angry\" or \"disappointed.\" It focuses on the timeline and the stakeholders' reaction.\n* **Implied Urgency:** The fact that the timeline has been pushed back twice suggests a need to address the issue proactively. There's an implied urgency to find a solution.\n\n**Overall:** The message is a professional and somewhat anxious communication. It's a plea for attention to a problem and a potential need for a solution before things escalate further. It's not necessarily a complaint, but a statement of a problem with a potential negative outcome.\n",
