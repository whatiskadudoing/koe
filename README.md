# Koe 声

### Speak. It types. That's it.

The open-source dictation app for macOS that actually respects you. No cloud. No subscription. No BS.

Your voice hits your Mac's neural engine and becomes text—instantly, privately, completely offline. Powered by [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit), the same tech behind the best speech recognition on the planet.

## Get Started

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whatiskadudoing/koe/main/install.sh | bash
```

One command. No Homebrew dependencies. No Xcode. Just paste and go.

## Why Koe?

| What you get | What you don't |
|--------------|----------------|
| On-device AI transcription | Cloud uploads |
| Works without internet | Monthly fees |
| Universal text insertion | Account creation |
| Multi-language support | Data collection |
| Open source, forever | Vendor lock-in |
| Zero headache setup | Complex configuration |

**Works everywhere** — Slack, Notion, VS Code, Terminal, your email, that random app you love. If it accepts text, Koe works with it. No plugins, no integrations to configure. Just your voice, anywhere.
