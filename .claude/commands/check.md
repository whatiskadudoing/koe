# Pre-Commit Check

Run all quality checks and fix any issues before committing.

## Steps

1. Run `make format` to auto-fix formatting
2. Run `make lint` and fix any lint errors
3. Run `make build` to verify compilation
4. Report any remaining issues that need manual attention

If all checks pass, the code is ready to commit.
